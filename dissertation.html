<h2>Dissertation</h2>
Most cases in the United States are decided by elected judges.  Yet, little scholarship has been produced about the consequences of these institutions for legal development. This project fills this need in the literature by providing and testing empirically a theory about the consequences of judicial retention institutions on the development of the law crafted by state judges.  Specifically, this project tests the hypothesis that the use of judicial elections affects the content of legal opinions created by state judges by inducing them to appeal to both the public and to elites.  This theory is tested through statistical analyses of the content of all state supreme court decisions over the last decade in four areas of law.<BR><BR>
First, by examining the relationship between state supreme court judges and the public, this project draws upon existing findings which demonstrate that judges---even those who do not rely on voters for their continued tenure in office---care about how their opinions are perceived by the public as well as recent arguments that public support for the judiciary is increased by readable opinions. Given that the importance of public support is magnified for those judges who must win the support of the electorate to keep their seat on the bench, this project tests the hypothesis that judges who face competitive judicial elections increase the readability of their opinions in an attempt to appeal directly to the public.<BR><BR>
Second, this project examines the relationship between state supreme court judges and political elites by exploring the constitutional grounding of state supreme court decisions.  State judges are able to manipulate the constitutional grounding of their opinions to prohibit a higher court from reviewing their decisions; decisions grounded solely in state constitutional law are not reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court and thereby may only be overturned by a constitutional amendment; this process typically requires the action of other political elites.  Given that opinions grounded in state law oftentimes involve issues that are particularly potent in electoral campaigns, this project tests the hypothesis that elected judges are less likely to rely on independent state constitutional grounds in their decisions.
