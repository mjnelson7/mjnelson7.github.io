        <h1><b>Bancroft and Covington Indicted</b></h1>
        <center><img src="images/breakingnews.png" alt="Breaking News" width="75%" align="center" /></center>
        <p> Midlands Attorney General, Ryan Sullivan, announced today that a Grand Jury has indicted both Chase Covington and Avery Bancroft on bribery charges.  Covington is the Chair of Midlands Gambling Commission. Bancroft allegedly bribed Covington in order to obtain a casino license.</p>

<p>Sullivan said, "This kind of backroom dealing must be stopped. This is the first step toward rooting out corruption in an agency that has long worked for the highest bidder rather than the people of this great state."</p>

<p>As reported earlier, the arrests were the result of a sting operation. New information has revealed that an unnamed individual working for Bancroft assisted an undercover police officer in the investigation. At this time, it is unknown whether the Bancroft employee was also implicated in the alleged crime.</p>

<p>Both Covington and Bancroft have declined to comment on their indictment.</p>

            <h3>Trial Team Wins National Championship</h3>
            <p>Midlands State University School of Law announced Friday that its trial advocacy team, led by law students Bailey Reynolds and Tyler Hartman, won the National Trial Team Competition.  "I was in a real trial last year," Tyler Hartman told BNN exclusively.  "I just copied what I saw the real attorneys do in that trial."</p>

            <!--<img src="images/harry.png" alt="" align="left" width="75px"  style="margin: 0px 5px" />-->
            <p>After years of preproduction, Trifecta Studios's Rocking Leo, starring Blue Ivy Bernstein was released last month.  No doubt due to the lack of Jacob Bennett's steady producing hand, the movie was a failure, both creatively and commercially.  Alex Grace, who was unable to star in the film because of time conflicts with <i>CSI: Midlands</i>, did attend the film's premiere.</p>

            <img src="images/sill.jpg" align="left" width="140px" alt="" />
            <p>Citing demographic trends, a new nursing home opened in Midlands May 1st.  "Midlands used to be all college students and immigrants, but the average age has skyrocketed in the last five years," the business's owner, Shelly Catone, told BNN.  "These days, it seems like one out of every six people you see acts like they are over the age of 70."</p>

            <!--<img src="images/RW.png" alt="" align="right" />-->
            <p>The Midlands City Maurauders announced will retire Michael "The Hammer" Harmon's jersey at the first home game next season, owner J.P. Boyd announced last week.  Mr. Harmon, of course, was acquitted of all charges in 2004 in relation to Tony Sturmanis's death.  No word on whether his ex-wife, Victoria Harmon-Hathaway will attend the game, but BNN will be watching closely.</p>
