        <h1><b>Avery Bancroft Arrested</b></h1>
        <center><img src="images/demo/breakingnews.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></center>
        <p>At approximately 2PM on April 19, 2015, the Midlands State Police Department arrested two people: Avery Bancroft, a prominent entertainment mogul in our state, and Chase Covington, the chairperson of the Midlands Gambling Commission.  Preliminary reports indicate that the arrest is linked to the Midlands Gambling Commissions's vote to provide Bancroft with a license to operate a second casino in Midlands on Friday, April 17, 2015.  A source inside the MSPD indicates that the arrest is the result of a long-term sting operation aimed at reducing the rampant corruption in Midlands government. BNN, as always, is on the scene.

            <h3>License Revoked</h3>
            <p>Dr. Campbell Solo, the incoming Chair of the Midlands Board of Psychology announced today that it has preemptively revoked the license of Logan Bashir, PhD., J.D. from practicing in the state. Solo said: "I know that Dr. Bashir was never actually licensed to practice in our state, but, I saw Logan testify in a trial, and, frankly, it was embarassing.  So, I'm making my first action as Chair of the Midlands Board of Psychology a preemptive ban on Dr. Bashir's ability to practice in this state ever again.  I don't know if I can actually do this, but I'm doing it anyway."</p>

            <p>Park owner J.C. Longstreet announced April 1 that the Tunnel of Terror will reopen for the Summer 2015 Season, despite bad publicity faced by the park in the wake of the felony murder of former park security officer Winston Thomas.  Previous BNN reports, citing anonymous sources, had indicated that the ride would remain closed until suspect Cameron Poole was apprehended. <i>[Ed: Eventually we will learn to get all of the facts before reporting.]</i></p>
